      <h1> Welcome to My portfolio</h1>
				<p>I am a Web Developer with a passion for the freedom of the internet and the space it creates for innovation. I'm currently based in the NYC-metro area and this gives me the opportunity to constantly network with others who share my passion. I pride myself in diligence and open mindedness and my thirst for new technologies. I also love laughs,playing music, sports, pool, and new friendships. Feel free to contact me or browse some of my projects using the links below Each version was built using different technologies.</p>
				
				<p>I pride myself on bringing tomorrow’s technologies to today’s marketplace. As a consultant I have pioneered SEO marketing strategies for emerging platforms - iPhone, Facebook, Twitter, Wordpress, mobile, etc. As a web developer I understand the tradeoffs between early adoption and lasting business impact. It's not enough to be first. A balance must be struck between innovation, sustainability and profit. Excellent relationship builder with a proven track record of closing deals. Results oriented thinker with constant focus on energing trends.
